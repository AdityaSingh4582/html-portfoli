<h1>The Best Movies according to Aditya</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2> 
<hr>
<h3>Harry Potter</h3>
<p>There are so many reasons of loving it and two of them is magic and hermoine granger</p>

<h3>Pirates of the Carribean</h3>
<p>Leonardo dicaprio as 'JACK' has played an amazing and very different role in this movie. The dialogue 'Why is the rum gone ?' has a different fan base. </p>

<h3>The legend of Bhagat Singh</h3>
<p>This movie is a brief explaination of how Shaheed Bhagat Singh gave his life and everything to the country for freedom, It gives me a lot of motivation to serve my 'Bharat Mata' </p>
